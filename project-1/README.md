Deploying EKS Clusters and Applications with CI/CD using Jenkins and Terraform

Major steps :
I. Setting up Jenkins Server with Terraform

            - Creating an EC2 instance with Terraform.

            - Installing necessary tools: Java, Jenkins, AWS CLI, Terraform CLI, Docker, Sonar, Helm, Trivy, Kubectl.

            - Configuring Jenkins server.

II. Creating EKS Cluster with Terraform

            - Writing Terraform configuration files for EKS cluster creation in a private subnet.

            - Deploying EKS cluster using Terraform.

III. Deploying NGinx Application with Kubernetes

            - Writing Kubernetes manifest files (YAML) for the NGinx application.

            - Deploying NGinx application to EKS cluster.

IV. Automating Deployment with Jenkins CI/CD

            - Creating Jenkins pipeline for automating EKS cluster creation and Nginx application deployment.

            - Integrating Terraform and Kubernetes with the Jenkins pipeline.

            - Configuring continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
